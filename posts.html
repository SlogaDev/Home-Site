              <h1>Internet Security Basics</h1>

              <p id="writing">
                
                Internet security is essentially a fantasy in today's infinitely complex world, much like protecting your identity without fail. This is much like anything in a world much bigger 
                than a signle individual, you cannot stop it, it is a matter of when many times not if. 

                As the internet has grown into a massive cultural and business center for mankind, it is also the center for less-than-desireable profiteering and threat actors who have motives 
                beyond legal constraint. This includes the very companies you are currently working and using the websites of in your daily lives right now. 

                Some of the most common attacks through clients on the web are listed here.

              </p>
              <p>
                Injection attacks are common from low maintenace or poorly desined websites (like mine), threat actors can place special characters in user input spaces to modify or use commands on the database of a website.
                <br>
                CSRF attacks are when people log into dummy sites, giving personal information away, this is done in emails as well. 
                <br>
                Misconfiguration of both the client and serverside machines and systems can leave open spaces for attacks
                <br>
                Forged URLs are when programs that dont have access control checks are breached by forging a URL throught to be hidden to regular users, maybe leaving open serious functionality of the systemic
                <br>
                Unvalidated redirects are when people are tricked after leaving a site for another using a link, thinking it was to a trusted site, much like CSRF attacks.
                <br>
                lastly and a huge one is Insufficient transport protection, when data doing to and from client and server can be intercepted, leading to sensitive information leakage.
              </p>

              <p>
                Lastly, here are some resources you can use. <br>

                <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/online-activities-internet-security">Webroot Article</a><br>
                This is mostly just tips, and also basically just an ad for Webroot's services.<br>
                <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-stay-safe-web">Firefox Article</a><br>
                This is much like the last, but instead leads to more articles of similar information and also mostly pertains to security using the Firefox Browser.<br>

                This is a 10 list generally containing to tips, though a bit more verbose and better rules overall, such as Making purchases from secure sites to being careful what and where you post. <br>

              <h2>The Internet of Everything</h2>

              <p id="writing">
                &emsp;&emsp;The Sea of Information brought forth by the Information Age brings with it new and exciting applications of the data we generate for it. 
                Namely the IoT technology that could eventually evolve into a ubiquitous use and therefore a highly optimized future society. Generally, we can see from the statistics of the trajectory of a society that we will see both positive and negative applications, though thoroughly positive changes are expected. The populist concerns weighed against this technology and its constituent lies heavy-handed claims and premonitions to the end of democracy and human-led institutions, modern conceptions of free will and autonomy, including conceptions of human prevalence, exceptionalism, and usefulness in the economy. The value of human life could additionally be put into question, the meaning of life generally even, as the aquiencense of IoE and alike pervade modern society from al corners. The most extreme is the myriad of additional potential negative consequences, some being apocalyptic or classically dystopian. Of IoT and its related and necessary technologies AI and Machine Learning as a subset, I plan to vindicate and reconfigure misconceptions and outline more realistic and perhaps give the ability for readers more acumen on the subject to more fully ruminatively inspect the trajectory of technological progress Western neoliberal and Eastern entities are bringing us towards with our current understanding.<br><br>
    
                &emsp;&emsp;The Internet of Everything and its partner technologies are the future of modernity, and exists more for the good of humanity than it detracts from. 

<br><br>WHAT IS THE INTERNET OF THINGS?<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp; Generally speaking, “The Internet of Things revolves around increased machine-to-machine communication; it’s built on cloud computing and networks of data-gathering sensors; it’s mobile, virtual, and instantaneous connection; and they say it’s going to make everything in our lives from streetlights to seaports “smart.” ” (Burrus, WIRED). This can be anything as simple as infrastructure, building materials, furniture, wiring, or small devices embedded in clothing, water systems, trees, etc; all for the purpose of gathering information and making decisions about the data it therefore gathers. As we know that progress is generally unstoppable, and there is little reason at face value to, say, make smart cement that can detect of a bridge is failing, or smart infrastructure that responds to its inhabitants in a more energy efficient manner, the leading topic is not rather the technology itself; but what we do with it. <br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;Data is infinitely spewed out of every corner of the modern world and where it is able to distantly reach.  The advent of computational thinking and information technology has led us to a potential crossroads of the future of the species. Modernity has instilled in us a passion for the human condition and our fellow man, a sort of self love, that was not a hundred years ago before the age of Romanticism entirely focused publicly on the love of divine entities over anything else. This new focus alongside the information age has led to a technology that seems to  optimize and improve the productivity and efficiency of all things; The Internet of Things. Potentially once could consider it to be the Internet of All Things once humanity extends its grip to the cosmos and quantifies and optimizes it for its own benefit.<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The Internet of Things going so well hand in hand with other technologies like inevitably clumps it as a group of implementations, it’s likely we will see the need of AI and Machine learning to process this sea of information and turn it into useful knowledge that actionable tasks can be made from to enact change. 

<br><br>WHAT OF POWER?<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Qualms about the actual application of the Internet of Things is a commonplace site of debate, this is also mainly because IoT is more than likely to rely on AI and Machine Learning and will be nature also employ the use of automation, removing necessary manpower for said applications, along with involving torrents of data being produced. This also means potentially higher level of possible surveillance and data collection for less than desirable purposes by private companies firstly, governments secondly. What exactly will come of this Silicon Valley promise tech? Better suited ads? Or potentially even dark gains to be won by the hands of authoritarian governments in parts of the world, thus also unfavorable departments of certain western countries (popularly the NSA). We can assume that this theoretical ubiquity of the tech could alter the way society is run. It then behooves us to attend to the potential pitfalls of this possible reality and move in a more humanistic and ethical fashion. <br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;It’s also been mentioned that IoT and the flow of data exponentiating is also a tell that the reliance on this data will change democratic institutions and human free will, as people will more likely pick the infinitely more experienced and reliable objective insights of algorithms that process the data generated from IoT sources. 

<br><br>IRON WILL NOT RULE  OVER THE ASHES<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;“We now have been told to worry about nanobots that will engulf us, robots that will enslave us, artificial intelligence that will turn us into raw materials and teenagers who will brew a genocidal virus or take down the internet from their bedrooms.” (Pinker, Enlightenment Now, 290). Apart from the human aspects, people also talk of general AI and robotics backfiring into a terminator-like state. This is a case of misunderstanding the entirely different concepts of knowledge and intent. AI’s, even if able to destabilize society with its clutches on infrastructure, has no literal reason to do so, say a self improving AI is capable of exponentially improving is processor’s, it would still need the help of hundreds of external factors to improve itself to a point of destructive capabilities, unlikely. People also talk of a godly AI capable of taking simple direction and acting on it literally, to suggest an AI capable of causing apocalyptic or tragic events would have such an elementary misunderstanding is ludicrous. <br><br><br>

THE REFUTATION<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;IoT is more likely to go the trend of nearly everything else in the past hundred years: Better. Its a surprise to note that nearly every model of the human experience has improved on a statistical basis, sugar is now more deadly than gunpowder (Runciman, 2016). Through the media and the availability bias life makes every off chance occurrence seem like an epidemic or systemic problem. While nothing is all good or all bad, The Internet of Things is more likely to have a positive influence on us overall, generally improving efficiency and optimizing our performance in life is more practical and less dystopian. There are extremes that anything can be taken to, and I find that our best bet is to rely on the power of people to limit the use of the technology to a reasonable use case by the hand of institutions. 

<br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;IoT is better in humanity's' toolbox than without, we need some way to quantify and more indepthly act when our big world get’s even bigger and harder for any one person or group of people to comprehend and make actions under.
