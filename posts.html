                &emsp;&emsp;The Sea of Information brought forth by the Information Age brings with it new and exciting applications of the data we generate for it. 
                Namely the IoT technology that could eventually evolve into a ubiquitous use and therefore a highly optimized future society. Generally, we can see from the statistics of the trajectory of a society that we will see both positive and negative applications, though thoroughly positive changes are expected. The populist concerns weighed against this technology and its constituent lies heavy-handed claims and premonitions to the end of democracy and human-led institutions, modern conceptions of free will and autonomy, including conceptions of human prevalence, exceptionalism, and usefulness in the economy. The value of human life could additionally be put into question, the meaning of life generally even, as the aquiencense of IoE and alike pervade modern society from al corners. The most extreme is the myriad of additional potential negative consequences, some being apocalyptic or classically dystopian. Of IoT and its related and necessary technologies AI and Machine Learning as a subset, I plan to vindicate and reconfigure misconceptions and outline more realistic and perhaps give the ability for readers more acumen on the subject to more fully ruminatively inspect the trajectory of technological progress Western neoliberal and Eastern entities are bringing us towards with our current understanding.<br><br>
    
                &emsp;&emsp;The Internet of Everything and its partner technologies are the future of modernity, and exists more for the good of humanity than it detracts from. 

<br><br>WHAT IS THE INTERNET OF THINGS?<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp; Generally speaking, “The Internet of Things revolves around increased machine-to-machine communication; it’s built on cloud computing and networks of data-gathering sensors; it’s mobile, virtual, and instantaneous connection; and they say it’s going to make everything in our lives from streetlights to seaports “smart.” ” (Burrus, WIRED). This can be anything as simple as infrastructure, building materials, furniture, wiring, or small devices embedded in clothing, water systems, trees, etc; all for the purpose of gathering information and making decisions about the data it therefore gathers. As we know that progress is generally unstoppable, and there is little reason at face value to, say, make smart cement that can detect of a bridge is failing, or smart infrastructure that responds to its inhabitants in a more energy efficient manner, the leading topic is not rather the technology itself; but what we do with it. <br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;Data is infinitely spewed out of every corner of the modern world and where it is able to distantly reach.  The advent of computational thinking and information technology has led us to a potential crossroads of the future of the species. Modernity has instilled in us a passion for the human condition and our fellow man, a sort of self love, that was not a hundred years ago before the age of Romanticism entirely focused publicly on the love of divine entities over anything else. This new focus alongside the information age has led to a technology that seems to  optimize and improve the productivity and efficiency of all things; The Internet of Things. Potentially once could consider it to be the Internet of All Things once humanity extends its grip to the cosmos and quantifies and optimizes it for its own benefit.<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The Internet of Things going so well hand in hand with other technologies like inevitably clumps it as a group of implementations, it’s likely we will see the need of AI and Machine learning to process this sea of information and turn it into useful knowledge that actionable tasks can be made from to enact change. 

<br><br>WHAT OF POWER?<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Qualms about the actual application of the Internet of Things is a commonplace site of debate, this is also mainly because IoT is more than likely to rely on AI and Machine Learning and will be nature also employ the use of automation, removing necessary manpower for said applications, along with involving torrents of data being produced. This also means potentially higher level of possible surveillance and data collection for less than desirable purposes by private companies firstly, governments secondly. What exactly will come of this Silicon Valley promise tech? Better suited ads? Or potentially even dark gains to be won by the hands of authoritarian governments in parts of the world, thus also unfavorable departments of certain western countries (popularly the NSA). We can assume that this theoretical ubiquity of the tech could alter the way society is run. It then behooves us to attend to the potential pitfalls of this possible reality and move in a more humanistic and ethical fashion. <br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;It’s also been mentioned that IoT and the flow of data exponentiating is also a tell that the reliance on this data will change democratic institutions and human free will, as people will more likely pick the infinitely more experienced and reliable objective insights of algorithms that process the data generated from IoT sources. 

<br><br>IRON WILL NOT RULE  OVER THE ASHES<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;“We now have been told to worry about nanobots that will engulf us, robots that will enslave us, artificial intelligence that will turn us into raw materials and teenagers who will brew a genocidal virus or take down the internet from their bedrooms.” (Pinker, Enlightenment Now, 290). Apart from the human aspects, people also talk of general AI and robotics backfiring into a terminator-like state. This is a case of misunderstanding the entirely different concepts of knowledge and intent. AI’s, even if able to destabilize society with its clutches on infrastructure, has no literal reason to do so, say a self improving AI is capable of exponentially improving is processor’s, it would still need the help of hundreds of external factors to improve itself to a point of destructive capabilities, unlikely. People also talk of a godly AI capable of taking simple direction and acting on it literally, to suggest an AI capable of causing apocalyptic or tragic events would have such an elementary misunderstanding is ludicrous. <br><br><br>

THE REFUTATION<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;IoT is more likely to go the trend of nearly everything else in the past hundred years: Better. Its a surprise to note that nearly every model of the human experience has improved on a statistical basis, sugar is now more deadly than gunpowder (Runciman, 2016). Through the media and the availability bias life makes every off chance occurrence seem like an epidemic or systemic problem. While nothing is all good or all bad, The Internet of Things is more likely to have a positive influence on us overall, generally improving efficiency and optimizing our performance in life is more practical and less dystopian. There are extremes that anything can be taken to, and I find that our best bet is to rely on the power of people to limit the use of the technology to a reasonable use case by the hand of institutions. 

<br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;IoT is better in humanity's' toolbox than without, we need some way to quantify and more indepthly act when our big world get’s even bigger and harder for any one person or group of people to comprehend and make actions under.

                  &emsp;&emsp;With psychology and its modern standards, tenants, and widely lauded figures, it is a science subject to change. With change being the only constant of the sciences (and the universe), save for it being unique to religious thought in its evidenced based nature, shields any of these branches from being considered a religion itself by common language. Psychology is one of these branches, virtually a set of  human constructed entities and ideas, that are subsequently acted upon, believed and assumed by some degree and followed by other people. In the weakly limited space of human cognition and its incapability towards understanding its modern information laiden environment fully truthfully or entirely at all. Though evidence allows decisions and behaviors to be rationally acted upon, there is always some measure of faith applied to essentially anything we do or think on a daily basis, reality as we subjectively understand it is taken for granted, because it has to, lest subsequent insanity or existential dread ensue. The profundity of this realization, that all things; Religions, nations, ideologies, traditions, values, and ideas, are all fundamentally imagined by somebody and then agreed upon by a group of people and enforced generally violently to make them substantial, is a realization that can cause people to come face to face with the uncomfortable reality of mortality, and the apparent directionlessness of the universe.<br><br>

                  &emsp;&emsp;Psychology is important to me because I’ve been searching since I was little, for basic answers to all things, I like to ask questions, to probe the reasoning for the answer to the question asked before, drilling down until I have a full perspective on why something is. Psychology as a branch of science uses reasoning and evidence as a basis for its findings, and is statistically more reliable for navigating daily life than a pure faith based lens does. There is a reason that science has virtually single-handedly rocketed humanity into a golden age (technically) of information sharing, prosperity, and wealth, with all directions of violence and suffering on a global scale pointing downwards (For an exhaustively thorough source of proof in the modern decline of violence and suffering, read The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker). 

                  &emsp;&emsp;In a sense, in my search for purpose and cause to the world around me, I've understood that science is the primary tool for attempting to objectively define your place in the universe. Evidence is not ubiquitous as humans are not technically deities, and therefore philosophy and ideologies and religious entities fill in any gaps, or some might delusionally fill in a gap that has already been well evidenced and documented (anti-vaxxers). To help you understand my perspective, when i say religion, I use this word to mean anything invented by humans that requires some level of faith or assumption to function. This includes anything from capitalism to communism, to christianity and the Keanu Reeves fanbase or Trump followers. All of these sets of values and ideas are a religion people use to process the world through, similar to how you might switch between lenses of the different schools of psychology to interpret a situation or behavior.<br><br>
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;As somebody who enjoys going beyond the scope of the materials for deeper understanding, I have indulged in multiple books and articles and wrote many journal entries over the time spent on this Psychology course. Generally I've looked at this class through a lens of better understanding my behavior so that I can influence it to achieve desirable behaviors that I want to make habits and acknowledge cognitive pitfalls that encourage me to be frustrated too easily or angry at people in ways that aren't efficient or agreeable or misinterpret situations or my own feelings. That being said, this class was used as more of a platform where I would check in and then directly afterwards dive into the rabbit hole of any related subjects, this is my personal use and outcome of the class. <br><br>
From this class, I found that I really enjoy philosophy - (Friedrich Neitzches’ Amor Fati found in Beyond Good and Evil , Immanuel Kants’ Formula for Humanity, and Plato’s contributions to stoicism are each things that i've found originally from related content found with this courses materials, turns out a good deal of philosophers are psychologists or use psychology in forming principles and ideas) 
- and the idea of teaching, not that I may forge forward for 8 years or whatever ridiculous hoops to get a teaching license but rather maybe smaller forms of teaching like sharing any of my knowledge online and teaching skills that I’ve learned or things that I’ve done, and insights i might find in my personal time reading and learning about whatever I fancy. The findings of my searching have led me to actually find a sort of peace within myself. Stoicism is still relevant with the modern world and its pressing issues. Amor Fati is an idea that suggests all hope is generated by religious thought and that hope leads not to better outcomes, but rather to a cyclical infinite chasm of destruction and suffering present throughout all of human history and its treating people as means rather than ends, and Kant’s Formula which suggests that human beings are inadvertently the universes means of understanding itself, and that our sentience and capability to organize our environment and make use of it is a plausible and positive avenue for purpose in life. 
<br><br>
    Now while I combine my learning of psychology with philosophy, I consider, in select cases, for these to be compatible and sister entities to each other, the science of psychology generates the data and objective explanation of our behaviors, some philosophies take these into practice in the form of ideology or principle. I used (Experience Psychology, 24) as a platform for understanding the psychology of human development, children namely. Toddlers are pleasure driven, anything outside of getting what they want is met with an existential tantrum, as they become older they learn transactional methods for achieving goals, “I hate school but i will do it because I want a better life”, “I will wear new clothing and present myself in my best wat instead of dingy clothes and no hygiene so people will like me”, teens will essentially do things with an expectation of reward or desired result, the bad side comes when you don’t get what you expected or nothing at all. True adults then (Most adults are still basically emotionally speaking children), ones in balance with both emotional mind and logical mind, live then my virtues and principles above all else, like courage, responsibility, honesty, open mindedness, etc. Factually driven principles agreeable with the better nature of humanity that mutually improve your life and others’ lives  are essentially bulletproof and only by childishly seeking pleasure or desires in excess can they inevitably fail. (Manson) The people most capable of these are world famous, A buddist monk during the events prior to the Vietnam war set himself on fire without flinching or moving from his spot while in apparent inner peace is the clearest, most valorous victory of mind over matter, willpower over primal instinct I can think of and is a world famous event.


    <br><br>
In the vein of conversation about mentorship, I’ve only sparingly considered being a parent, but have more recently mulled over the prospect and potential outcomes and my feelings on it. As somebody who doesn't particularly care for tradition or culture; picking and choosing as I see fit and most practical, consider the positive and negative realities of parenthood. Being a parent in some way is a part of being an animal, and something that could possibly help make you a better person, or nothing at all. Psychology comes into parenthood in that it can help you not hate your children. Children are generally selfish and indulgent proto-adults and it’s easy to like them in small sittings but not long periods of time depending on their personality, but with psychology and understanding why a child may be the way they are, and how best to help them grow, will help you not only make them a good person, but also not rip your hair out when they scream for a toy in the grocery store or whatever psychotic and selfish things children like to do. 
<br><br>
Consequently, interpersonal relationships of any kind, romantic or platonic, along with your children, can be helped by understanding the human brain and how people think, optimizing the way you communicate and the way you present yourself to lead more successful interactions with others. Having children can be easily contested as no longer an ineffable part of humanity with the current modern world removing any real need to have children. Socializing however is uncompromising in its ability to destroy you if you don't get enough of it, so having a thorough understanding of others and your own intentions and feelings is a great step towards having decent relationships. 

<br><br>
Lastly, learning to accept yourself through the lens of psychology is a difficult one, there are schools of psychology and multiple ways to interpret yourself, the current scientific model is that all emotions and cognitive processes are chemically driven and influenced by the environment and circumstance as easily as the wind; basically shaking the foundation of that spark-of-life, specialness inside of you humanists that have dominated western ethos. 
<br><br>
People can find many reasons to hate themselves and endlessly find themselves in a state of dissatisfaction even after previous bars for “I’ll be happy when” were met; fulfillment and happiness is a state of mind and impossible to permanently achieve or know fully. That being said, I find that psychology, as a branch of science, tells me that I am a fragile, insignificant growth of carbon living in a tiny rock in the middle of nowhere, and that any moment an asteroid could come and obliterate the planet and the universe would keep moving as if nothing had happened. That probably sounds depressing, but in fact it’s liberating. The realization that we dont matter is the same reasoning you can use to stop hating yourself and stop caring about what society wants of you. Feel afraid to go to college or start on that project? Nothing matters in the end anyways, so why not just do it? A limited life means that no negativity from others should stop you from doing what you dream of doing. The flawed nature and limitedness of humankind simply means we are free to fail and try and do things other people don’t like sometimes if we think we need to (by this I mean like go be a painter or game developer regardless of what your parents think, not be an ax murderer or serial shoplifter.)
<br><br>
Psychology tells us that the human mind is a flawed but powerful machine, it is what makes us unique as a species and uniquely qualified to dominate the planet and potentially the galaxy (If we don’t blow ourselves up) and do great or terrible things on a godly scale. I think that what i understand about human behavior now is this most important rule: Happiness is a limited state of mind, and not something to strive for, if you want real contentment and growth as a person, limitation and self discipline is the path of freedom, not aimless indulgence. “Doing what makes you happy” is basically the Joker to your Batman, we say it quite a lot in our culture but happiness is literally a self destructive drug, if what makes you happy is doing nothing but whatever gives you your happiness high like playing games endlessly or partying or writing long paragraphs on facebook about how vaccines cause autism and how im better than everybody else and having no real aspirations, you're going to just end up depressed and unfulfilled every time you remove yourself from your trance of mediocrity and be worse than if you had done things out of virtue rather than blind pursuit of dopamine.
