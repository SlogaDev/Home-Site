                <h2>The Last Mageknight</h2>
                <p>This is the evolution of a small action game concept I started working on. the below video is the latest state</p>

                <p>First, I wanted to get an idea for the setting as well as basic use of animation and first-person arms, which i've never done.
                  colliders for weapons and a basic health system were implemented near the start as well.

                  I would add an environment and start creating character models and UI. This uses
                  a Playstation 1 style shader that jitters the faces of meshes. I also would
                  create each model you see myself in blender, using textures from freetextures.com
                  where I would then downscale them to 256x256 or even lower.

                  Finally up to about 4 weeks ago before I stopped, I did away with the
                  two-handed sword and changed it out for a smaller sword version i edited from the
                  large one and then a new shield model as well as animations.

                <h2>DUSK HARBOR</h2>
                <p>This is a small environment project I made for a horror game idea. It had probably been a year since I did anything gamedev related apart from
                  coursework and tutorials, and I decided I wanted to get more into modeling. This game also uses a PSX style shader and downscaled res textures with
                  a point filter. The models were all made in blender and the textures came from freetextures.com
                </p>

              <p>This is the written premise of the game, if i ever get around to working on it again!</p>

                  This render was made using Processing 3 and made for learning purposes.
                  I asked anonymous user on an internet forum what to make and returned with this. 
                  I personally encourage using Processing 3 as a platform for learning programming if you are interested.

                  The model, background, and music were found at random online. The pink waves
                  are made with a plane that uses Perlin noise. The YouTuber Coding Train has a good tutorial on this concept.

                  Project Aegis is my idea for a full-size game, and will be used 
                  as a platform for learning skills and getting experience. 

                  Ive worked on this on and off for about a month, its been in hibernation 
                  as an idea since i starte college and will probably remain that way until 
                  I have significantly more free time to work.

                <p>
                  This idea came from Ghost in The Shells' Spider Tank, or Think Tank. 
                  The weird combination of a turtle, mech walker, and cyclops is basically just me learning modelling with Blender 3D, 
                  i'd only ever made cups and tables before this point.
