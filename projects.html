                  This render was made using Processing 3 and made for learning purposes.
                  I asked anonymous user on an internet forum what to make and returned with this. 
                  I personally encourage using Processing 3 as a platform for learning programming if you are interested.

                  The model, background, and music were found at random online. The pink waves
                  are made with a plane that uses Perlin noise. The YouTuber Coding Train has a good tutorial on this concept.

                  Project Aegis is my idea for a full-size game, and will be used 
                  as a platform for learning skills and getting experience. 

                  Ive worked on this on and off for about a month, its been in hibernation 
                  as an idea since i starte college and will probably remain that way until 
                  I have significantly more free time to work.

                  This idea came from Ghost in The Shells' Spider Tank, or Think Tank. 
                  The weird combination of a turtle, mech walker, and cyclops is basically just me learning modelling with Blender 3D, 
                  i'd only ever made cups and tables before this point.
