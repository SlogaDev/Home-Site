                  This archive is a collection of websites, utilities,
                  assets, and media for referencial, education, or entertainment purposes I've come across 
                  and either actively use in projects or found fun.
                  None of these entities are owned by me and are simply here in case
                  anybody is interested.

                <p>
                  With the flash player becoming a legacy technology, most browsers are seeking
                  to remove flash altogether by the end of 2020. the Flashpoint project
                  was created to conserve the thousands of beloved classic games, animations, and simulations
                  that made up much of the early internet, compiling all of them into on playlists
                  and genres. 
                  <br><br>
                  There are two versions of the download, a full archive link which is over 200 GB
                  or a slightly limited version which downloads the content as you use them, both are free.
                  Project is ongoing and likely the download-as-you-go will probably recieve more support
                  and functionality with time.

                  Itch.io, like Gamejolt, is an Indie game marketplace and 
                  publishing ground for small time indie devs. Generally this is the place
                  short of steam and other platforms, to publish your game and 
                  make a name for yourself. In addition, the website is packed with games great for reference
                  and ideas and the website is well formatted and supports collections.
                  <br><br>
                  Itch also has a desktop application for use and is one of the better places to go public. 
                  Itch also has heavy support for hosting and participating in Game Jams for getting experience.
